Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I created the pygame in the python file and inserted the images in the python file.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to get the game to run with superman flying in between the enemies. I have to make the game start and stop when the user hits one of the enemies.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Some of the images are not the size I want it to be and I have to change that in Adobe after affects. I had some errors with some of the images.
